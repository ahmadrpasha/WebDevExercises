    <h1>Ostrich</h1>

    <hr>
    <p>Ostriches are large flightless birds of the genus Struthio in the order Struthioniformes, part of the infra-class
        Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, and
        kiwis. There are two living species of ostrich: the common ostrich, native to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa
        and the Somali ostrich, native to the Horn of Africa.[2] The common ostrich was also historically native to the
        Arabian Peninsula, and ostriches were present across Asia as far east as Mongolia during the Late Pleistocene
        and possibly into the Holocene. They lay the largest eggs of any living land animal. With the ability to run at
        70 km/h (43.5 mph), they are the fastest birds on land. They are farmed worldwide, particularly for their
        feathers as they are used as decoration
        and feather dusters. Their skin is also used for leather products. Ostriches are notable for being the heaviest
        living birds.

    <h2>Taxonomic history</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The genus Struthio was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus was used by Linnaeus and other early
        taxonomists to include the emu, rhea, and cassowary, until they each were placed in their own genera.[1] The
        Somali ostrich (Struthio molybdophanes) has recently become recognized as a separate species by most
        authorities, while others are still reviewing the evidence.

    <h3>Distribution and habitat</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>oday, ostriches are only found natively in the wild in Africa, where they occur in a range of open arid and
        semi-arid habitats such as savannas and the Sahel, both north and south of the equatorial forest zone.[11] The
        Somali ostrich occurs in the Horn of Africa, having evolved isolated from the common ostrich by the geographic
        barrier of the East African Rift. In some areas, the common ostrich's Masai subspecies occurs alongside the
        Somali ostrich, but they are kept from interbreeding by behavioral and ecological differences.[12] The Arabian
        ostriches in Asia Minor and Arabia were hunted to extinction by the middle of the 20th century, and in Israel
        attempts to introduce North African ostriches to fill their ecological role have failed.[13] Escaped common
        ostriches in Australia have established feral populations.
